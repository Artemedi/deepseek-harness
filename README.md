# DeepSeek Harness

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [DeepSeek AI](https://deepseek.com).

It uses an architecture where **everything is a plugin**, and is powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://github.com/cordiverse/paper).

## Developer preview

DeepSeek Harness is currently in _developer preview_ and is iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness.git
cd deepseek-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm dsh web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm dsh web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.

### Update and restart a systemd user service

If Harness runs as `dsh-web.service`, update it from the repository root:

```sh
cd /var/home/Trintos/projects/deepseek-harness
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
systemctl --user restart dsh-web.service
systemctl --user --no-pager --full status dsh-web.service
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:3081/
```

The service must report `active (running)` and the HTTP check must return `200`. Refresh the existing `http://127.0.0.1:3081` page with `Ctrl+Shift+R`. Do not start a separate Vite server for the complete Web UI. Before updating, back up `~/.dsh`, which contains sessions and settings; if the build fails, do not restart the service.
